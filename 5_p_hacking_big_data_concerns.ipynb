So far we have learned how to leverage controlled models to analyze statistical significance and whether we can take findings seriously. However, when you introduce human bias and large amounts of data, it becomes easy to \"shop\" for findings that seem significant and credible, but really are just random chance. We will address Texas Sharpshooter Fallacy, bias, and human factors when it comes to scientific research. "

    "As humans, we are strangely wired to be biased. We tend to look for patterns rather than reason why patterns might mislead us. Data bias is inevitable in statistics and data science work, so you should always be actively looking for it. If I survey college students at my local university and use my findings to represent all universities in the United States, there is obviously going to be bias. I'm favoring that university being represented over other universities, and making generalizations based on a limited sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of bias, but one of the most pernicious types in statistics is *self-selection* bias. This occurs when certain types of subjects are more likely to include themselves in the experiment. If you go on a flight and survey the passengers what their favorite airline is, do not be surprised when it is the very airline they are flying! If you are doing phone surveys in the middle of a weekday, do not be surprised when most of your respondents are retirees, stay-at-home parents, and non-working individuals. These all can distort your findings because your intended population you are wanting to sample from is not including themselves in the sample. \n",

    "This is a modernized version of a real statistics problem back in WWII. (https://apps.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA091073) \n",
    "\n",
    "The Center for Naval Analyses conducted a study on mitigating the loss of bombers. After analyzing fleets of bombers returned from missions, they conclude surfaces that statistically show the most damage should be prioritized for more armor. But a Hungarian mathematician named Abraham Wald pointed out a fatal flaw with this heuristic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The flaw: the data only captured survived aircraft, and therefore the approach was completely wrong.**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of survivership bias, where again we make faulty inferences on the survived population while the deceased population is never accounted for. While many would cynically say the data is incomplete, the data still provides a valuable clue to solve our objective. The question we should be asking: why did the aircraft return safely despite the observed damage? \n",
    "\n",
    "With success, Abraham flipped the theory by armoring the undamaged parts of the aircraft, inferring these were likely the critical areas causing a plane to go down and never returning to base. This not only saved aircraft and lives but was a pivotal moment for the war effort. "
